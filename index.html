<h1> TOP 5 FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES OF THE SIMPSONS </h1>

<p> The beloved Simpson is the the longest running show EVER! Everyone knows about the Simpons. I grew up watching the hilarious yellow characters for decades. It's almost as if they're a part of my famiy. Some my fondest childhood memories invovle me laughing hysterically when the show is aired on every Sunday night at 8pm. Yes, I was obsessed and watched the show religiously.</p>
<p>There are plenty of pages on the web that focuse on the the Simpson family. I want to pay tribute and dedciate this page to the supporting casts of the successful show. They do deserve the proper recognition.  </p>

<h3>Here is my list: </h3>

<div>
	<h2>#5 Charles Montgomery Monty Burns</h2>
 	<img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/simpsons/images/a/a7/Montgomery_Burns.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/270?cb=20100602062705" alt="Mr. Bruns">
 	<p>"It feels good to be bad." Every good story needs a good villian. Starting the count down would be the infamous Mr. Burns. The wealthiest man in Springfield. The owner of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant and Homer Simpson's boss. An elderly skinny man with the most recognizable devious laugh as he steepled his fingers gently.</p>

 	<h4>Mr. Burns's Memorable Quotes:</h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li>"What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?"</li>
 		<li>"EXCELLENT!" ( you read it in his voice. =D ) </li>
 		<li>"Smithers, release the hounds"</li>
 	</ul>

	<h2>#4 Morris "Moe" Szyslak </h2>
	<img src="http://assets.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-simpsons/photos/simpsons-character/Moe/swsb_character_fact_moe_550x960.png" atl="Moe" >
	<p> Moe is the owner and bartender of Homer's favorite bar, Moe's Tavern. Moe is known to be unattractive, rude, and easily irritable. Often time, you will spot an obese drunk man name Barney who is passed out in the bar. Moe is naturally very gullible, that makes him a very easy target to be teased and picked on. </p>

	<h4>Moe's Memorable Quotes:</h4>
	<ul>
 		<li>"I'm Moe, or as the ladies like to call me 'Hey, you behind the bushes.' "</li>
 		<li> "Well, I'm better thant dirt! Well, most kinds of dirt." </li>
 		<li>"Maybe someday I'll turn into a swan"</li>
 	</ul>

	<h2>#3 Milhouse Van Houten</h2>
	<img src="http://i.imgur.com/WiIPY5h.jpg" alt="Milhouse">
	<p> Milhouse is a shy, insecure 10 year old boy who is Bart Simpson's best friend. His physical appearance reflects his bright blue hair with very thick glasses. He is easiily peer pressured and often finds himself in trouble by Bart.</p>
	<h4> Milhouse's Memorable Quotes</h4>
	<ul>
 		<li>"But my mom says I'm cool."</li>
 		<li>"There are no more 'great days', Bart; just 'days'" </li>
 		<li>*point to a narrow cave* "This is where i come to cry." </li>
 	</ul>

	<h2>#2 Ralph Wiggum</h2>
	<img src="https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-12/26/10/enhanced/webdr07/enhanced-3165-1451142158-2.jpg" alt="Ralph Wiggum">
	<p> The show is full of wicky oddballs. The oddest of them all would be Ralph Wiggum. He is a classmate of Lisa Simpson at Springfield Elementary School. Ralph's dialogue is insanely nonsensical. Later in the show, we find out that he was dropped on his head as baby, which explains why he has social disabilities. Ralph is the outcast amoung his class. But Lisa Simpson would always try her best to be respectful to him. </p>
	<h4> Ralph's Memorable Quotes</h4>
	<ul>
 		<li>"Me fail English? That's unpossible."</li>
 		<li>"My cat's breath smells like cat food." </li>
 		<li>"The doctor said I wouldn't have so many nose bleeds if I kept my finger outta there."</li>
 	</ul>

	<h2>#1 Clancy Wiggum aka Chief Wiggum</h2>
	<img src="http://assets.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-simpsons/photos/swsb_character_fact_wiggum_550x960.png" alt="Chief Wiggum">
	<p> Chief Wiggum is the father of Ralph Wiggum and the head of police of the Springfield Police Department. A stereotypical police officer who is lazy, obese, ignorant, and has a strong appetite for fatty donuts. It is obvious that he is not good at his job. He has no concern for the public safety. Given his nature, he always has many silly, comical incidents and dialogues. </p>
	<h4>Chief Wiggum's Memorable Quotes</h4>
	<ul>
 		<li>"I'd rather let 1,000 guilty men go free than chase after them." </li>
 		<li>"Uh no, you've got the wrong number. This is 9-1...2." </li>
 		<li>"Let him go. A man who drive so fast, has no time for a ticket."</li>
 	</ul>
